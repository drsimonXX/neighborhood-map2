#Neighborhood Map
Neighborhood Map is a site that highlights some of the best food places in the South Suburbs of Chicago using the Google Maps API. In addition to the Google Maps API, the project was built using JavaScript, jQuery, Knockout.js and the Wikipedia API. The project demonstrates skills acquired and strengthened via [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com "Udacity") as part of its [Front-end nanodegree course](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001 "Udacity Front-End Nanodegree"). 

*This is the project that passed Udacity's project review.*

##How To Launch the Project

##Site Functunality
- "Show Listings" populates the map with markers that highlight the best food places in the South Burbs. This is especially useful after using the distance filter.
- "Hide Listings" removes the markers from the map, making viewing of search results easier.
- Click a location listing link to reveal location information on the map, including an image, a Wikipedia link and a link to the street view.
- Click a marker on the map to reveal the same information as is revealed when the corresponding side link is clicked.
- Filter locations according to what type of food they offer.
- For each highlighted food place, the project searches Wikipedia and produces a link to its Wikipedia page in the marker's window. Some locations may not have a Wikipedia page yet.

##How To Use the Site
- To filter locations by what type of food they offer, locate the search box on the lefthand side of the screen underneath the list of locations and enter in the type of food you're seeking. The filter box's placeholder is "I'm hungry for..."
- To find out more information about the highlighted food places, click the markers on the map or the side links. The markers will show a window with the business name, an image of the business, a Wikipedia link and street view options.
